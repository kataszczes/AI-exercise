# The Best Raw Diet for Your Dog – A Simple Guide

---

## 1. Introduction  
Many dog owners are turning to raw diets to provide a more natural and nutritious way to feed their pets. A raw diet can improve coat health, boost energy levels, and promote better digestion. However, proper balance is key to ensuring your dog gets all the essential nutrients.

## 2. Basics of a Raw Diet  
A raw diet typically consists of:
- **Muscle Meat:** The main protein source (e.g., chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, or fish).  
- **Organ Meats:** Essential for vitamins and minerals (e.g., liver, kidney, heart).  
- **Raw Meaty Bones:** Provide calcium and support dental health (e.g., chicken wings, beef ribs).  
- **Vegetables & Fruits (Optional):** Some owners add leafy greens, carrots, or blueberries for fiber and antioxidants.  
- **Supplements:** Omega-3s, probiotics, or vitamin/mineral supplements if needed.  

### Safe Food Handling Tips:  
- Always source fresh, high-quality ingredients.  
- Store raw food properly (freeze in portions and thaw as needed).  
- Clean surfaces and bowls thoroughly after feeding.  

## 3. Sample Raw Diet Recipe  
**Ingredients:**  
- 70% muscle meat (e.g., 450 g chicken thighs)  
- 10% raw meaty bones* (e.g., 65 g chicken necks)  
- 10% organ meats (e.g., 65 g beef liver)  
- 10% optional vegetables (e.g., chopped spinach, carrots)  
- 5 ml fish oil (for Omega-3s)

>*This percentage refers to bone content only - you have to calculate the bone to meat ration in a given type of meaty bone. Please refer to the table below.

**Raw Meaty Bones (RMB) Composition**

| Raw Meaty Bone | Bone % | Meat % |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Chicken Wings  | 40%    | 60%    |
| Chicken Necks  | 50%    | 50%    |
| Duck Necks     | 50%    | 50%    |
| Duck Wings     | 45%    | 55%    |
| Chicken Frame  | 70%    | 30%    |
| Pork Ribs      | 30%    | 70%    |

*Note: These percentages are approximate and may vary slightly based on the specific cut and source.*

**Preparation:**  
1. Chop meat, organs, and bones into appropriate sizes based on your dog’s breed and chewing habits.  
2. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  
3. Divide into meal-sized portions and freeze for future use.  
4. Thaw portions in the fridge before feeding.  

**Feeding Tips:**  
- Feed about **2-3% of your dog's body weight per day**, split into two meals.  
- Adjust portions based on activity level and weight changes.  

## 4. Transitioning & Common Mistakes  
### How to Transition Gradually:  
- Start by mixing small amounts of raw food with the current diet.  
- Gradually increase raw food while reducing kibble over 7-10 days.  
- Monitor your dog’s digestion and energy levels during the switch.  

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:  
- **Unbalanced Meals:** Ensure variety and correct ratios of meat, organs, and bones.  
- **Feeding Cooked Bones:** Only raw bones are safe—cooked bones can splinter.  
- **Ignoring Hygiene:** Properly store, handle, and clean after raw feeding.
